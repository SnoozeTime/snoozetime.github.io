&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;My experience with kucoin REST API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been playing a bit with cryptocurrency recently and Kucoin exchange, with its numerous coins, seemed like a great
place to experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, as often in software, reality and expectations are not aligned. Let's forget about Kucoin limitation as an exchange
 (no market order?), what really hurt was the REST API quality.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Getting details of an order does not work: &lt;a href="https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin/issues/23"&gt;https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin/issues/23&lt;/a&gt; (Check out the answer from
the exchange support for extra fun). Then, when trying to cancel an order, I received a "System Error". It appeared that 
orders could not be canceled through the API for some time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Morale of the story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It looks like I am bashing Kucoin here. I am not (well maybe a bit).  The whole crypto space is young and moving at
an extreme pace. Competition between exchanges is hard and it does not surprise me that not everything is working
as expected. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a developer, one should program defensively when dealing with external parties, even more when the external party 
cannot be trusted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
