I'm always amazed when I watch people mastering emacs. They can do everything
so much faster and with less keystrokes. However, if you have no experience with
elisp like me, extending emacs to do what I want seems like a daunting task.

As always, reading books and blogs about Emacs can help (ironic that I am writing about this isn't it),
but practice beats everything when it comes to learing a new programming language.
That's why, after doing 20 times the same operation, I decided to implement some shortcut in Elisp.

* What I am trying to achieve

I am working in multiple projects at a time, both in my professional and personal
life so I need to way to create notes quickly, and organize them so that I can
find them easily. I used to use Evernote for this but after switching everything
to Emacs I prefer using Orgmode.

My custom Emacs command will prompt me for a project and a note name, and will
create a file in the correctly directory that I can edit.

* Let's dissect the problem a bit
