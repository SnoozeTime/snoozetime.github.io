<h2 id="sec-1">My experience with kucoin REST API</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I've been playing a bit with cryptocurrency recently and Kucoin exchange, with its numerous coins, seemed like a great
place to experiment.
</p>

<p>
However, as often in software, reality and expectations are not aligned. Let's forget about Kucoin limitation as an exchange
 (no market order?), what really hurt was the REST API quality.
</p>

<p>
Getting details of an order does not work: <a href="https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin/issues/23">https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin/issues/23</a> (Check out the answer from
the exchange support for extra fun). Then, when trying to cancel an order, I received a "System Error". It appeared that 
orders could not be canceled through the API for some time.

It looks like I am bashing Kucoin here. I am not (well maybe a bit).  The whole crypto space is young and moving at
an extreme pace. Competition between exchanges is hard and it does not surprise me that not everything is working
as expected.

<p>
As a developer, one should program defensively when dealing with external parties, even more when the external party 
cannot be trusted.
