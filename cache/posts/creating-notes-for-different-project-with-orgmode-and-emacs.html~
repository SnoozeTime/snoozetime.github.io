I'm always amazed when I watch people mastering emacs. They can do everything
so much faster and with less keystrokes. However, if you have no experience with
elisp like me, extending emacs to do what I want seems like a daunting task.
</p>

<p>
As always, reading books and blogs about Emacs can help (ironic that I am writing about this isn't it),
but practice beats everything when it comes to learing a new programming language.
That's why, after doing 20 times the same operation, I decided to implement some shortcut in Elisp.

<h2 id="sec-1">What I am trying to achieve</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I am working in multiple projects at a time, both in my professional and personal
life so I need to way to create notes quickly, and organize them so that I can
find them easily. I used to use Evernote for this but after switching everything
to Emacs I prefer using Orgmode.
</p>

<p>
My custom Emacs command will prompt me for a project and a note name, and will
create a file in the correctly directory that I can edit.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Let's dissect the problem a bit</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Here I need a way to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Find the list of my current projects
</li>
<li>Get a name for the new note
</li>
<li>Create the file name from above
</li>
<li>Create the note and switch to orgmode

<h3 id="sec-2-1">How to test Elips easily</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Elisp is much easier when you can test commands one by one. There is a good tutorial <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/">here</a> on lisp-interaction-mode.
This tutorial also links the great essay by Norvig about how to learn a programming language so I thought it was
appropriate to link it <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">here</a> as well.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Find all the projects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Projects here are represented as subdirectory of the projects folder. Basically, the folders are structured as: ~/notes/projects/,
so notes for project 'example' would be stored under ~/notes/projects/example/.
</p>

<p>
Here comes the first function. It will fetch all the directories under the projects folder and ask the user to choose one.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defvar my/project-path &quot;~/notes/projects&quot;)

(defun my/pick-project ()
  &quot;Prompt user to pick a choice from a list.&quot;
  (let ((choices (directory-files my/project-path)))
    (message &quot;%s&quot; (completing-read &quot;Open bookmark:&quot; choices ))))
</pre></div>

<p>
Here, <i>directory-files</i> will list all the files in the given directory (one improvement would be to keep only folders).
Next line will prompt me for a choice in this list of file and will return my choice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Get a note name</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
To read a string from an user, read-string is the way to go.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defun my/choose-note-name ()
  &quot;Prompt user to choose a note name&quot;
  (read-string &quot;Choose the note name: &quot;))
</pre></div>

<p>
This will open a mini-buffer and will display "Choose the note name: ". It will return the user's answer.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Concatenate everything to get the note path</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
I played around a bit with clojure so I was expecting concatenating a list of strings to be as easy, but unfortunatly
it is slightly more complicated here. I am using the concatenate function that requires a type specifier.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(concatenate &#39;string &quot;string1&quot; &quot;string2&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>
In the next function, I am also using the let form which let (:')) me write cleaner code.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defun my/create-note-name ()
  (let ((project-name (my/pick-project))
	(note-name (my/choose-note-name)))
    (concatenate &#39;string
		 me/project-path
		 &quot;/&quot;
		 project-name
		 &quot;/&quot;
		 note-name
		 &quot;.org&quot;)))
</pre></div>

<p>
The hardcoded slashes are ugly and I pretty sure there is a better way to create the path from tokens&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Create the note</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
You can use find-file to create a file and edit it in the current window. In my case, I want to open a new window to edit
the note so I am using find-file-other-window instead.
</p>

<p>
The function looks like:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defun my/create-new-project-note ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (my/create-note-name)))
    (find-file-other-window filename)
    (org-mode)))
</pre></div>

<p>
Notice (interactive) which is there to make the function available when typing M-x. (org-mode) is also called after switching
buffer so that the correct mode is used for editing the note.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">It's done! But&#x2026;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There is a lot of things to improve:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'd like to be able to create a new project if it does not exist instead of having to create a new folder myself.
</li>
<li>directory-files lists all files in a directory, including non-folders and ".", "..". These need to be filtered out.
</li>
<li>Concatenating is ugly.
</li>
<li>After creating a note, I am using yasnippet to set the note skeleton. There should be a way to automize that.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
That first experience with Elisp was anyway encouraging as I used this function everyday. Stay tuned for other code dissection ;)
