        Creating notes for different project with orgmode in Emacs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2018</span>

    <p>I’m always amazed when I watch people mastering emacs. They can do
everything so much faster and with less keystrokes. However, if you have
no experience with elisp like me, extending emacs to do what I want
seems like a daunting task.</p>

<p>As always, reading books and blogs about Emacs can help (ironic that I
am writing about this isn’t it), but practice beats everything when it
comes to learing a new programming language. That’s why, after doing 20
times the same operation, I decided to implement some shortcut in Elisp.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-am-trying-to-achieve">What I am trying to achieve</h1>

<p>I am working in multiple projects at a time, both in my professional and
personal life so I need to way to create notes quickly, and organize
them so that I can find them easily. I used to use Evernote for this but
after switching everything to Emacs I prefer using Orgmode.</p>

<p>My custom Emacs command will prompt me for a project and a note name,
and will create a file in the correctly directory that I can edit.</p>

<h1 id="lets-dissect-the-problem-a-bit">Let’s dissect the problem a bit</h1>

<p>Here I need a way to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the list of my current projects</li>
  <li>Get a name for the new note</li>
  <li>Create the file name from above</li>
  <li>Create the note and switch to orgmode</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-test-elips-easily">How to test Elips easily</h2>

<p>Elisp is much easier when you can test commands one by one. There is a
good tutorial <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/">here</a> on
lisp-interaction-mode. This tutorial also links the great essay by
Norvig about how to learn a programming language so I thought it was
appropriate to link it <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">here</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-the-projects">Find all the projects</h2>

<p>Projects here are represented as subdirectory of the projects folder.
Basically, the folders are structured as: ~/notes/projects/, so notes
for project ‘example’ would be stored under ~/notes/projects/example/.</p>

<p>Here comes the first function. It will fetch all the directories under
the projects folder and ask the user to choose one.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">
(defvar my/project-path "~/notes/projects")

(defun my/pick-project ()
  "Prompt user to pick a choice from a list."
  (let ((choices (directory-files my/project-path)))
    (message "%s" (completing-read "Open bookmark:" choices ))))

</code></pre>

<p>Here, <em>directory-files</em> will list all the files in the given directory
(one improvement would be to keep only folders). Next line will prompt
me for a choice in this list of file and will return my choice.</p>

<h2 id="get-a-note-name">Get a note name</h2>

<p>To read a string from an user, read-string is the way to go.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">
(defun my/choose-note-name ()
  "Prompt user to choose a note name"
  (read-string "Choose the note name: "))

</code></pre>

<p>This will open a mini-buffer and will display “Choose the note name: “.
It will return the user’s answer.</p>

<h2 id="concatenate-everything-to-get-the-note-path">Concatenate everything to get the note path</h2>

<p>I played around a bit with clojure so I was expecting concatenating a
list of strings to be as easy, but unfortunatly it is slightly more
complicated here. I am using the concatenate function that requires a
type specifier.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">(concatenate 'string "string1" "string2")
</code></pre>

<p>In the next function, I am also using the let form which let (:’)) me
write cleaner code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">
(defun my/create-note-name ()
  (let ((project-name (my/pick-project))
    (note-name (my/choose-note-name)))
    (concatenate 'string
         me/project-path
         "/"
         project-name
         "/"
         note-name
         ".org")))

</code></pre>

<p>The hardcoded slashes are ugly and I pretty sure there is a better way
to create the path from tokens…</p>

<h2 id="create-the-note">Create the note</h2>

<p>You can use find-file to create a file and edit it in the current
window. In my case, I want to open a new window to edit the note so I am
using find-file-other-window instead.</p>

<p>The function looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">
(defun my/create-new-project-note ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (my/create-note-name)))
    (find-file-other-window filename)
    (org-mode)))

</code></pre>

<p>Notice (interactive) which is there to make the function available when
typing M-x. (org-mode) is also called after switching buffer so that the
correct mode is used for editing the note.</p>

<h1 id="its-done-but">It’s done! But…</h1>

<p>There is a lot of things to improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’d like to be able to create a new project if it does not exist
instead of having to create a new folder myself.</li>
  <li>directory-files lists all files in a directory, including
non-folders and “.”, “..”. These need to be filtered out.</li>
  <li>Concatenating is ugly.</li>
  <li>After creating a note, I am using yasnippet to set the note
skeleton. There should be a way to automize that.</li>
</ul>

<p>That first experience with Elisp was anyway encouraging as I used this
function everyday. Stay tuned for other code dissection ;)</p>

<h1 id="full-code">Full code</h1>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp}">
(defvar my/project-path "~/Nextcloud/notes/projects")

(defun my/pick-project ()
  "Prompt user to pick a choice from a list."
  (let ((choices (directory-files my/project-path)))
    (message "%s" (completing-read "Open bookmark:" choices ))))

(defun my/choose-note-name ()
  "Prompt user to choose a note name"
  (read-string "Choose the note name: "))


(defun my/create-note-name ()
  (let ((project-name (my/pick-project))
    (note-name (my/choose-note-name)))
    (concatenate 'string
         me/project-path
         "/"
         project-name
         "/"
         note-name
         ".org")))

(defun my/create-new-project-note ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (my/create-note-name)))
    (find-file-other-window filename)
    (org-mode)))
