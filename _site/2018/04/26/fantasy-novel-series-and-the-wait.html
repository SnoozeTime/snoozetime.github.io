  <h1 class="post-title">Fantasy novel series, and the Wait</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2018</span>
  <p>I’ve always been an avid reader of long fantasy novel series. As a kid,
I used to read Lord of the ring, Harry Potter (does it count? Yes it
does!) and basically everything I could put my hand on.</p>

<p>More recently I’ve been a huge fan of the work of Brandon Sanderson. For
those who don’t know, Sandersonis the epic fantasy writer. He builds
entire world in different series of books that are somewhat connected in
the grander scheme: <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/">Sanderson website</a></p>

<p>So yes, I really love epic Fantasy. But amazing book series come with a
big caveat: the Wait. As opposed to the Thrill while reading, the Wait
is the excruciable period from when I finish a book until the next one
is released. Let’s take a few example: The Stormlight Archive by
Sanderson is a novel series which contains 3 books at the moment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Way of Kings, published August 31, 2010</li>
  <li>Words of Radiance, published March 4, 2014</li>
  <li>Oathbringer, published November 14, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been in a state of passive suffering for at least 7 years.</p>

<p>Another great series of novel is <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> by Patrick
Rothfuss. Here, the last book has been published 7 years ago!</p>

<p>And also, Game of Thrones people?</p>

<p>To be clear, I am very grateful to the authors out there that are
publishing these fantastic books. But how to satisfy the Wait? I’ve
found two ways some far:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read more novels. This has the benefit of making me forget a bit
about the previous book I read, but it might add more series to the
wait list.</li>
  <li>Read novel series that have already ended. That way no more wait.
Just a feeling of emptiness at the end.</li>
</ol>
