 Lagom4Ni
==========

Lagom4Ni is a theme for `Nikola <https://github.com/ralsina/nikola>`_.
It is a port of `Lagom <https://github.com/swanson/lagom>`_, a Jekyll
blog theme with just the right amount of style.

Lagom4Ni (Lagom for Nikola) is an attempt for a play of words to mean, "just
the right amount for you" in Swedish... [I'm no Swede!]

Lagom4Ni is a slightly customized version, and no an exact port of
Lagom.  It may not have remained Lagom anymore. ;-)
