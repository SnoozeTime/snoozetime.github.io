My experience with kucoin REST API
==================================

I've been playing a bit with cryptocurrency recently and Kucoin
exchange, with its numerous coins, seemed like a great place to
experiment.

However, as often in software, reality and expectations are not aligned.
Let's forget about Kucoin limitation as an exchange (no market order?),
what really hurt was the REST API quality.

Getting details of an order does not work:
<https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin/issues/23> (Check out the
answer from the exchange support for extra fun). Then, when trying to
cancel an order, I received a "System Error". It appeared that orders
could not be canceled through the API for some time.

Morale of the story
===================

It looks like I am bashing Kucoin here. I am not (well maybe a bit). The
whole crypto space is young and moving at an extreme pace. Competition
between exchanges is hard and it does not surprise me that not
everything is working as expected.

As a developer, one should program defensively when dealing with
external parties, even more when the external party cannot be trusted.
